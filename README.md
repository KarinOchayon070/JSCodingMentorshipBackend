# Online Coding Web Application - "Coding Mentorship" - Backend üíª
- This repository contains the backend code for the Online Coding Web Application, a real-time coding collaboration platform designed for mentors and students to interact and work on JavaScript code remotely.
-  The backend is built using nods.js & express and provides essential functionality for code block management, real-time collaboration, and communication between clients.

## Features üåø 
- Code Block Management: Mentors can create and manage code blocks, each containing a title and a JavaScript code snippet. The mentors will have a read-only state, allowing them to monitor the students without making any changes to the code blocks.
- Real-time Collaboration: The application uses Socket.io to enable real-time code updates. When a student makes changes to a code block, the changes are instantly reflected for both the student and the mentor.
- Syntax Highlighting: The backend utilizes CodeMirror to highlight the syntax of JavaScript code, providing a better coding experience.
- MongoDB Integration: All code block details, including titles, code snippets, and solutions, are stored in a MongoDB database. This ensures persistent data storage and easy retrieval of code blocks for mentor-student sessions.
